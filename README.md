A React.js + Java Spring project with FireStore database

The application is a package returning service that allows customers to hire contractors to return their purchased products from carriers such as UPS, FedEx, and Amazon. It works like services such as DoorDash, Postmates, Uber, Lyft, but for returning packages. 

How it works: 

  - The user can register on the website and start using the service
  - The user can apply to become a driver and earn money
  - The return process consists of entering current address, locating the nearest drivers, and 
    assigning the driver to the current user requesting a driver to take their package.
  - The user has to attach the package label to the package or provide the driver with both. Instructions will be clearly stated on the webpage
  - The user can then get notified of the package being successfully dropped off
